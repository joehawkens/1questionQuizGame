# Overview

This app was created to further my understanding of the Kotlin language and the Android SDK environment. It's a simple quiz app that asks the user 1 question. It's multiple choice and provides 4 answers. If the user picks incorrectly it will guide them to a losing screen, if correct, a winning screen. In both screens they have the option to play again, which will bring them back to the landing page. Altough the scope of this app is very simple I learned a ton about both Kotlin and the Android SDK.
Mostly the uses of XML files, the importance and scope of Intentions, and understanding the IntelliJ IDE and how it runs the SDK. I now feel more confident in my ability  to create other apps that provide a lot more content and functionality using these tools.
